crds-styles
==========

`crds-styles` provides the primary CSS framework and global style patterns that
power [crossroads.net](http://crossroads.net) and its related properties.

Any elements and/or implementation details included within the [Digital Design
Kit (DDK)](http://github.com/crdschurch/crds-styleguide) are provided by this
NPM package. Any deviations from the patterns defined there should be
implemented in the client application.

Installation
----------

There are two options for including crds-styles in your project.

### Option #1 (Recommended) - External Build

The easiest way to include crds-styles is by loading the external CSS file. The
build is deployed to S3 and is available through our Cloudfront distribution.

This approach is most useful when you don't need to override any styles, or
when the styles you're overriding don't require needing crds-styles' (or
Bootstrap's) sass variables.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//d1tmclqz61gqwd.cloudfront.net/styles/crds-styles-2.0.0.min.css">
```

_(Note: Replace `2.0.0` with the desired version.)_

### Option #2 - NPM via package.json

If your project needs to use crds-styles' sass variables or requires that you
build crds-styles locally, you can bring it in via NPM in your `package.json`
file.

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "crds-styles": "2.0.0"
  }
}
```

You can also use a reference to the GitHub URL in cases where you would like to
use upstream changes that haven't yet been released.

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "crds-styles": "crdschurch/crds-styles#development"
  }
}
```

Usage
----------

Import the stylesheet in your application's main '.scss'
file using the following convention. You can optionally override
any of the customizable Bootstrap variables prior to import.

```scss
@import '~crds-styles/assets/stylesheets/crds-styles';
```

_Note: The tilde character (`~`) is a shorthand reference to `node_modules`,
provided by either [Webpack's SASS Loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader#imports)
or [node-sass-tilde-importer](https://github.com/matthewdavidson/node-sass-tilde-importer),
depending on your preferred build configuration._

#### Local Development - NPM packages

When making changes to crds-styles locally and in wanting them to be reflected
in your project, you should follow the NPM/package.json approach for importing
styles.

In this case you'll want to link to a local copy of crds-styles. Assuming the
`crds-styles` repo resides in the same local directory as your project, you can
do the following to setup the symlink.

```text
$ cd path/to/your/project-directory
$ rm -rf node_modules/crds-styles
$ npm link ../crds-styles
```

SVGs
--------

Any project consuming `crds-styles` will need to update their build process in
order to access SVG files. For information on adding new icons to `crds-styles`
please refer to [the
documentation](https://github.com/crdschurch/crds-styles/blob/development/src/assets/svgs/README.md).

### Angular CLI Build

Angular CLI ships with the ability to copy assets into a project. To include the
icons (or any other assets), first install crds-styles into your `node_modules`
directory via NPM. Then add the following to your `assets` config in
`.angular-cli.json` file:

```js
{
  "apps": [{
    "assets": [
      {
        "glob": "icons.svg",
        "input": "../node_modules/crds-styles/assets/svgs",
        "output": "assets"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Note that you could change `icons.svg` to `*` to copy all of crds-styles' svg
assets into your project.


#### Contributing to the DDK

The DDK is now a Jekyll project. The Styleguide is on continuous deployment and updates branches are merged into `master`.

Styles are still in `crds-styles` but they are now linked through `git submodules` instead of `npm`.

### Updating Styles in Styleguide

When working in the new `crds-styleguide` and `crds-styles` for the first time you will need to add the `crds-styles` submodule (We prefer using SSH so you don't need to remember your password.):

`$ git submodule add git@github.com:crdschurch/crds-styles.git vendor/gems/crds-styles `

When working in a new branch/project you must run two commands: `git submodule init` to initialize your local configuration file, and `git submodule update` to fetch all the data from that project and check out the appropriate commit listed in your superproject. (From [Git Docs](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules))

You will be able to see all your submodules defined in the `.gitmodules` file.

If you don’t want to have to constantly run `git submodule update`, you can set a global config to do this for you automatically using: `git config --global submodule.recurse true`

#### Commits and PRS

##### Get Latest Version

Before  making changes in `crds-styles`, it's advisable to make sure you have the latest version.

While in your `crds-styleguide` branch cd into your submodule folder and then `git checkout development`. and then `git pull origin development`.

Next create/checkout the same branch your working on in `crds-styleguide`.

##### Make and Push Commits

When you're ready to make commits to your `crds-styles` changes, make sure you're in your submodule folder on the same branch as your `crds-styleguide` commits. Make and push your `crds-styles` commits from here.

After you make commits in `crds-styles`, cd back to your `crds-styleguide` branch and run `git status`. You will see:
`modified:   [your folder path]/crds-styles (modified content)`

When you see this, you should add a commit in `crds-styleguide` to update `crds-styles` in your project.

##### PRs

When work is ready to be merged into `crds-styles` and `crds-styleguide`, work should be merged into `crds-styles` first.

Outstanding `crds-styleguide` PRs may need to be updated with the newest `crds-styles` commit hash before they are merged.

Versioning
--------

Versions are released sprintly following [semantic
versioning](https://semver.org/). In other words:

- Bug fixes and other minor changes: Patch release, increment the last number,
  e.g. 1.0.1
- New features which don't break existing features: Minor release, increment the
  middle number, e.g. 1.1.0
- Changes which break backwards compatibility: Major release, increment the
  first number, e.g. 2.0.0

Bumping versions
--------
1. Starting in the  `development`  branch, update the version number in the `package.json`. (look [here](https://github.com/crdschurch/crds-styles#versioning) for versioning)
2.  `npm install`
3. Then run  `bundle install`  to update the  `Gemfile.lock`
4. Push up changes and merge into  `development` and a [TeamCity](https://ci.crossroads.net/) build will fire.
5. Once the build passes, merge the changes into `master`.
6. After merging into `master`  goto [TeamCity](https://ci.crossroads.net/) and find “Styles Deploy” under “Release” (You should see that there are pending changes). 
7. Then you want to click the “Run” button. This build will update the release number in GitHub and NPM and it will update files in an S3 bucket
